/**
 * This class creates JSON files for block models.
 * Please note that this class does not have enough attributes to support a Block Model creator for all aspects of block models. Even if it does, it would be a complete mess to
 * create complex models in Java.
 * For complicated block models, apps like Blockbench is recommended, as they have a full development team creating an app to let you create Minecraft models for free.
 * <a href="https://www.blockbench.net/">Click here to go to Blockbench.</a> (Minecraft Resource Manager's developer is not sponsored by Blockbench.)
 * <p>
 * Regardlessly, this class provides basic tools and templates that can cover 95% of the blocks you are adding, such as stairs, slabs, signs etc.
